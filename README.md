A modern landing page showcasing Europe's leading technology ecosystems. Built with semantic HTML and CSS, focusing on clean design, typography, and responsive layout.

## Project Overview

This project is part of my Full Stack Development journey at Rocketseat. The challenge was to create a tourism landing page using only HTML and CSS, with emphasis on semantic structure and visual appeal.

**Key focus areas:**
- Clean design 
- Semantic HTML for accessibility and SEO
- Modern CSS layouts 
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Professional content architecture

## Stack

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup
- **CSS3** - Flexbox, Grid, and CSS Custom Properties
- **Google Fonts** - Inter font family

## Features

- Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- CSS custom properties for easy theme customization
- Semantic HTML5 tags (`header`, `nav`, `section`, `article`, `footer`)
- Hover effects and smooth transitions

## Responsive Breakpoints

- **Desktop:** 1120px+ (full layout)
- **Tablet:** 768px - 1119px (adjusted spacing)
- **Mobile:** < 768px (stacked layout, hidden navigation)

Following industry-standard breakpoints. 
Based on Bootstrap and common device widths (iPad: 768px, iPhone: 375-414px).

## Running Locally

Simply open `index.html` in your browser, or use a local development server:

**Using Python:**
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

**Using Node.js:**
```bash
npx serve
```

**Using VS Code:**
Install "Live Server" extension and click "Go Live"

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I practiced and improved:
- Semantic HTML structure and accessibility
- CSS Flexbox for one-dimensional layouts
- CSS Grid for two-dimensional layouts
- CSS custom properties (variables) for maintainability
- Responsive design with media queries
- Typography and spacing systems
- Modern design principles

## Next Steps

- JavaScript for smooth scrolling
- Individual destination pages
- Dark mode toggle
- API integration


## Notes

**Why Flexbox and Grid?**
I chose to use Flexbox and Grid because they are the industry standard. 

**Texts**
Some of the explanatory texts were created or refined with AI assistance (such as ChatGPT).
